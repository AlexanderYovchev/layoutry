   * resizes need this: in normal flow, a box's top-left corner is wherever
   * the flow algorithm puts it, not an independently settable coordinate,
   * so growing `preferredWidth` alone can only ever extend the box's right
   * edge — there is no such thing as "move the left edge" without also
   * shifting where the box sits. Margin, specifically, not `transform`: a
   * transform only shifts where a box *paints*, never how much flow space
   * it *reserves*, so a sibling positioned after it would still be placed
   * using the box's raw (unshifted) height/width, drifting out of sync
   * with the box's own anchored edge — margin genuinely participates in
   * flow, so growing north/west by shrinking marginTop/marginLeft
   * correctly and simultaneously moves this box's edge *and* adjusts how
   * much space precedes it, keeping every sibling exactly where its own
   * flow position says it should be. 0/0 for an element resized only from
   * its east/south edges, which need no compensating shift.
